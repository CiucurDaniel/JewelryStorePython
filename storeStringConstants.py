# storeStringConstants.py
# author: Ciucur Daniel

# This file helps us keep the CONSTANTS strings that are used in the Store app
# having this file makes it easier to change the strings in a single place and see the change everywhere in the code
# This file is a practice similar to how Android app dev "string.xml" is done
